# quickRockPaperScissors
Really basic and simple python project I made this a while ago... one of my frist! Its a GUI-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game and I used tinker, which is usually included in most python installations. This way the user can click on their choice and then get whatever feedback based on the computers choice.
